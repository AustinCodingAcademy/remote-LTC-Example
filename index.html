  <h3>Do not go gentle into that good night</h3>
  <p><span class="first-letter">D</span>o not go <span class="gentle">gentle</span> into that good night,<br>
    Old age should burn and <span class="light">rave</span> at close of day;<br>
    Rage, rage against the <span class="dark">dying</span> of the light.<br>
    <br>
    Though wise men at <span class="dark">their</span> end know dark is right,<br>
    Because their words had forked no <span class="light">lightning</span> they<br>
    Do not go <span class="gentle">gentle</span> into that good night...</p>
